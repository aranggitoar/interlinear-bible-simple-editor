# Changes and License Notice
Every data source code here is taken from the
[Javascripture](https://github.com/javascripture/javascripture) software,
except `byzparsed.json`. They are originally in a JavaScript format, here its
slightly modified into a JSON format.

The licenses for them are unknown, but all of them should be in the public
domain. For [Open Scripture's Hebrew
Bible](https://github.com/benihyangbaik/interlinear-bible-simple-editor/blob/main/data/morphhb.json)
in the other hand, which is the source for `morphhb.json` here, that's
originally `morphhb.js` in Javascripture, is [licensed with CC BY
4.0](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb/blob/master/LICENSE.md). CC BY
is [compatible with all version of GNU
GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#ccby).

The `byzparsed.json` is a modified [parsed
version](https://github.com/byztxt/byzantine-majority-text/tree/master/parsed)
of [the Byzantine Majority Text by
Robinson-Pierpoint](https://github.com/byztxt/byzantine-majority-text). The
code used to modify it will be uploaded soon, basically it is a trimmed and
modified version of [librobinson by Dr. Ulrik
Sandborg-Petersen](https://github.com/byztxt/librobinson).

The license for the original Byzantine Majority Text is public domain. The
modified version here is licensed with GNU FDLv1.3 to ensure freedom of the
next user. As JSON files does not accept comments, so the copyright and license
notice is added in a separate file called `byzparsed-copyright`, and the whole
GNU FDLv1.3 license is in `byzparsed-LICENSE`.
