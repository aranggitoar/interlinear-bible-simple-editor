# Changes and License Notice
The `morphhb.json` is a modified `morphhb.js` from the
[Javascripture](https://github.com/javascripture/javascripture) software, which
is basically [Open Scripture's Hebrew
Bible](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb). It is [licensed with CC BY
4.0](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb/blob/master/LICENSE.md). CC BY
is [compatible with all version of GNU
GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#ccby).

The `byzparsed.json` is a modified [parsed
version](https://github.com/byztxt/byzantine-majority-text/tree/master/parsed)
of [the Byzantine Majority Text by
Robinson-Pierpoint](https://github.com/byztxt/byzantine-majority-text). The
code used to modify it could be found
[here](https://github.com/benihyangbaik/byztxt-parsed-to-morphhb), which is
basically a trimmed and modified version of [librobinson by Dr. Ulrik
Sandborg-Petersen](https://github.com/byztxt/librobinson).

The license for the original Byzantine Majority Text is public domain. The
modified version here is licensed with GNU FDLv1.3 to ensure freedom of the
next user. As JSON files does not accept comments, so the copyright and license
notice is added in a separate file called `byzparsed-copyright`, and the whole
GNU FDLv1.3 license is in `byzparsed-LICENSE`.
